        <h2>Meet The Admin!</h2>
        <p>You found the about page! I've always been interested in anime and Japanese culture
            in general and I'm excited to share some of that here. I find that the stories that
            can be told in anime have been some of the best I've had the chance to experience and 
            I'm always looking for a new show to sink my teeth into. This project is just starting out but I hope 
            to grow and evolve this and would love to have y'all along to join me!
